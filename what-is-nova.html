  <h1>What is NOVA?</h1>

  <h2>NOVA is a digital coin created with one purpose: education.</h2>
  <p>
    It is not meant to promise wealth or act as an investment vehicle. Instead, NOVA gives people a
    hands-on way to learn how tokens work, how wallets interact with smart contracts, and how blockchain
    transactions are recorded.
  </p>

  <h2>The idea behind NOVA</h2>
  <p>
    The idea behind NOVA is to remove the fear of the unknown and to prevent mistakes — or at least soften
    the impact of them — that people might otherwise make with real money. Most people hear “crypto” and
    immediately think of speculation or scams. NOVA is the opposite: a transparent, fixed-supply token where
    everything — from the contracts to the claim site — is openly shared. Because NOVA has no monetary value,
    learners can experiment freely: testing how wallets connect, how claims work, and how transactions are
    recorded on-chain, all without risking their savings. It’s about giving people their first safe interaction
    with blockchain technology.
  </p>

  <h2>NOVA’s supply, distribution phases, and sub-denominations</h2>
  <p>
    NOVA’s supply, distribution phases, and even its sub-denominations (Lira and Volt) are carefully designed
    to demonstrate how digital assets can be bridged across networks, staked to simulate long-term holding,
    or securely managed within wallets. These features are not about profit, but about showing learners how
    modern blockchain ecosystems actually function — giving them a chance to practice bridging, staking,
    and holding in a safe, educational environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, bridging demonstrates how a token can move between Ethereum and Base, staking introduces
    the idea of committing assets over time, and holding shows what it means to safeguard tokens in a wallet.
    Each exercise is structured so that users gain confidence in the mechanics of blockchain, without financial risk.
